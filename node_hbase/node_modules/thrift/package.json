See the License for the\nspecific language governing permissions and limitations\nunder the License.\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack with an\nassociated code generation mechanism for RPC. Thrift provides clean\nabstractions for data transport, data serialization, and application\nlevel processing. The code generation system takes a simple definition\nlanguage as its input and generates code across programming languages that\nuses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers.\n\nThrift is specifically designed to support non-atomic version changes\nacross client and server code.\n\nFor more details on Thrift's design and implementation, take a gander at\nthe Thrift whitepaper included in this distribution or at the README.md files\nin your particular subdirectory of interest.\n\nHierarchy\n=========\n\nthrift/\n\n  compiler/\n\n    Contains the Thrift compiler, implemented in C++.\n\n  lib/\n\n    Contains the Thrift software library implementation, subdivided by\n    language of implementation.\n\n    cpp/\n    go/\n    java/\n    php/\n    py/\n    rb/\n\n  test/\n\n    Contains sample Thrift files and test code across the target programming\n    languages.\n\n  tutorial/\n\n    Contains a basic tutorial that will teach you how to develop software\n    using Thrift.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nSee http://thrift.apache.org/docs/install for an up-to-date list of build requirements.\n\nResources\n=========\n\nMore information about Thrift can be obtained on the Thrift webpage at:\n\n     http://thrift.apache.org\n\nAcknowledgments\n===============\n\nThrift was inspired by pillar, a lightweight RPC tool written by Adam D'Angelo,\nand also by Google's protocol buffers.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nIf you are building from the first time out of the source repository, you will\nneed to generate the configure scripts.  (This is not necessary if you\ndownloaded a tarball.)  From the top directory, do:\n\n    ./bootstrap.sh\n\nOnce the configure scripts are generated, thrift can be configured.\nFrom the top directory, do:\n\n    ./configure\n\nYou may need to specify the location of the boost files explicitly.\nIf you installed boost in /usr/local, you would run configure as follows:\n\n    ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local\n\nNote that by default the thrift C++ library is typically built with debugging\nsymbols included. If you want to customize these options you should use the\nCXXFLAGS option in configure, as such:\n\n    ./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O2'\n    ./configure CFLAGS='-g -O2'\n    ./configure CPPFLAGS='-DDEBUG_MY_FEATURE'\n\nTo enable gcov required options -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage enable them:\n\n    ./configure  --enable-coverage\n\nRun ./configure --help to see other configuration options\n\nPlease be aware that the Python library will ignore the --prefix option\nand just install wherever Python's distutils puts it (usually along\nthe lines of /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/).  If you need to control\nwhere the Python modules are installed, set the PY_PREFIX variable.\n(DESTDIR is respected for Python and C++.)\n\nMake thrift:\n\n\tmake\n\nFrom the top directory, become superuser and do:\n\n\tmake install\n\nNote that some language packages must be installed manually using build tools\nbetter suited to those languages (at the time of this writing, this applies\nto Java, Ruby, PHP).\n\nLook for the README.md file in the lib/<language>/ folder for more details on the\ninstallation of each language library package.\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThere are a large number of client library tests that can all be run\nfrom the top-level directory.\n\n          make -k check\n\nThis will make all of the libraries (as necessary), and run through\nthe unit tests defined in each of the client libraries. If a single\nlanguage fails, the make check will continue on and provide a synopsis\nat the end.\n\nTo run the cross-language test suite, please run:\n\n          make cross\n\nThis will run a set of tests that use different language clients and\nservers.\n",
